## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and interactive elements
recharts | For visualizing balance history and credit score
lucide-react | For friendly, clear icons

## Notes
- Theme should be "Kid-Friendly": Bright colors, rounded corners, large text.
- Google Fonts: 'Fredoka' for headings (playful, rounded), 'Nunito' for body (highly readable).
- Dashboard needs a "Gamified" feel - maybe a credit score meter.
- Admin view needs to handle "Fining" users (deducting money).
